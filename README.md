A well-established dataset is built from scratch by gathering social media comments. Various Machine Learning models
and Deep Learning models were trained with the corpus. The system works hierarchically. At the identification level,
an input text is identified as religious or non-religious. Then, at the classification level, a religious text is
further classified into abusive or non-abusive.
